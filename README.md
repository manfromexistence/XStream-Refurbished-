# Running a Blockchain project for Dev Space at upwork.

## Description

This project aims to create a functional blockchain application using Ethereum smart contracts. It provides a solid foundation for developers who want to build decentralized applications (DApps) or explore blockchain technology.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. add enviroment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NFTSTORAGE_KEY (this is the key you can get from https://nft.storage/)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT (this wallet connect key, you can this from https://walletconnect.com/)
   ```
3. build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

hooray you are done!

<!-- ## Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Includes basic smart contracts written in Solidity.
- **Truffle Setup**: Configured Truffle framework for development, testing, and deployment.
- **Ganache Integration**: Local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
- **Web3.js Integration**: Interaction with smart contracts from a web application.
- **Metamask Integration**: Wallet management and transaction signing.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Next.js**: Tech stack.
- **Truffle**: Framework for Ethereum development.
- **Ganache**: Local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
- **Metamask**: Browser extension for wallet management.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-project-starter.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd blockchain-project-starter
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Metamask:
   - Create an Ethereum account.
   - Connect Metamask to the local Ganache network.

## Usage
1. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

2. Migrate contracts to the local blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and connect Metamask to the local network.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
